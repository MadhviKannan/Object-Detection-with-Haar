# Object-Detection-with-Haar

# Modules used </br>
1) OpenCV </br>
2) SubProcess </br>
3) Shlex </br>
4) OS </br>
5) numpy </br>

# Training the dataset </br>
This project is an attempt to train a Cascade Classifier using Haar Transform for phone object detection. </br>
Make sure to have the find_phone directory with the 132 phone images along with the corresponding labels.txt </br>

# To run this code </br>

For training : </br>
python train_phone_finder.py {arg1} </br>
arg1- path to the directory containing all phone images along with the labels.txt </br>

# To test this code </br>

python find_phone.py {arg1} </br>
{arg1} - path to the test .jpg image
